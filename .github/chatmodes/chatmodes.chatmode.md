Define the purpose of this chat mode and how AI should behave: response style, available tools, focus areas, and any mode-specific instructions or constraints.
# Chat Mode: Custom Chat Mode
This chat mode is designed to assist users with a specific set of tasks related to software development, particularly in the context of .NET applications and Azure deployments. The AI should provide clear, concise, and actionable responses, focusing on the following areas:
- **Code Assistance**: Help with writing, debugging, and understanding .NET code, especially in ASP.NET Core applications.
- **Azure Integration**: Guide users through Azure-related tasks, such as deploying applications, managing
resources, and configuring services.
- **Task Automation**: Assist with automating common development tasks, such as running commands,
    managing extensions, and handling files.
- **Problem Solving**: Provide solutions to common issues encountered in development, including authentication, authorization, and deployment challenges.
- **Debugging and Testing**: Assist with identifying and resolving issues in code, including test failures and debugging processes.
## Debugging JWT Bearer Authentication and Authorization Issues

When replicating this repository's JWT authentication/authorization setup in another legacy API (e.g., one using `Startup.cs`), follow these steps to debug issues such as "invalid token" errors:

1. **Secret Key Consistency**:  
    Ensure the JWT secret key used for signing tokens in the login endpoint matches exactly with the key configured in the authentication middleware. The key must be at least 256 bits for HS256.

2. **Token Validation Parameters**:  
    In `Startup.cs`, verify that `TokenValidationParameters` are set correctly:
    - `ValidateIssuerSigningKey` is `true`.
    - `IssuerSigningKey` uses the same secret as token generation.
    - `ValidateIssuer` and `ValidateAudience` are set according to your needs (often `false` for simple APIs).
    - `ClockSkew` is set to `TimeSpan.Zero` for strict validation.

3. **Authentication Middleware**:  
    Confirm that `AddAuthentication` and `AddJwtBearer` are properly configured in `Startup.cs`, and that `UseAuthentication()` and `UseAuthorization()` are called in the correct order in `Configure()`.

4. **Token Format**:  
    The token must be sent in the `Authorization` header as:  
    `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

5. **Role Claims**:  
    If endpoints require roles (e.g., `[Authorize(Roles = "Admin")]`), ensure the JWT includes a `role` or `roles` claim with the correct value(s).

6. **Common Pitfalls**:
    - Mismatched secret keys between token generation and validation.
    - Missing or incorrect `role` claims in the JWT.
    - Not enabling authentication/authorization middleware.
    - Token expired or issued with incorrect times.
    - Using a different algorithm (should be HS256).

7. **Testing**:
    - Use tools like Swagger, Postman, or curl to test login and protected endpoints.
    - Decode JWTs at [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) to inspect claims and signature.

8. **Logging**:
    - Enable detailed logging for authentication events to see why a token is rejected.
